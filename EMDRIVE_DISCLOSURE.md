## Abstract
This disclosure describes methods of enhancing thrust generation in asymmetric resonant cavities (EM Drives) through application of **Collapse Coordinate System (CCS)** and **Probability Origin Formalism (POF)** principles. The improvements are distinct from prior EM Drive patents (e.g., Shawyer, NASA Eagleworks) and gravitational wave generator patents (e.g., US 10,322,827 B2).

## Claims (Defensive)

1. **Nested cavity geometry**  
   - An asymmetric resonant cavity comprising alternating wide/narrow sections (SSH-like lattice), producing recursive collapse bias and enhanced probability origin asymmetry.  

2. **Boundary anchoring**  
   - Dielectric inserts arranged at cavity boundaries to function as **invariant anchors**, stabilizing collapse recursion and preventing thrust washout.  

3. **Floquet-driven modulation**  
   - Application of time-periodic frequency sweeping of RF drive (Floquet modulation) to induce recursive collapse stepping within the cavity, increasing net momentum shift.  

4. **External bias field**  
   - Superimposition of weak DC magnetic or electric fields along the cavity axis to tilt the recursion ladder (λ + g(x) bias/envelope), aligning thrust vector consistently.  

5. **Combination methods**  
   - Any combination of nested geometry, boundary anchoring, Floquet modulation, and external bias fields, wherein the system produces enhanced thrust not accounted for in prior patents.

## Engineering Rationale
- **POF:** asymmetric geometry biases collapse toward one probability origin (–0 vs. +0).  
- **CCS:** recursive detuning is stabilized by boundary anchors and stepped forward with Floquet modulation.  
- **Result:** local thrust appears in violation of conservation, but global invariants are preserved across recursive embeddings.

## Distinction from Prior Art
- Shawyer & NASA EM Drive patents: cover conical cavities, standing-wave asymmetry only.  
- US 10,322,827 B2: covers spherical cavity gravitational wave generators.  
- **Novelty here:** explicit recursive collapse engineering — nested geometries, anchored invariants, Floquet modulation, and bias fields — not described in any known EM Drive patent.

## Defensive Purpose
This document constitutes **prior art**. It prevents privatization of recursive-collapse-based cavity propulsion methods while reserving the author’s rights.
