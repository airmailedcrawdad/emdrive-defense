**Defensive publications on EM Drive cavity propulsion, establishing prior art under the Collapse Coordinate System (CCS) and Probability Origin Formalism (POF). All rights reserved.**

---

This repository preserves **open defensive disclosures** related to EM Drive and cavity-propulsion concepts.  
It documents enhancements and reframings of EM Drive operation in terms of collapse-coordinate engineering:

- **Nested cavity geometries** (SSH-like alternating segments)  
- **Boundary anchoring** with dielectric inserts  
- **Floquet-driven modulation** of RF resonance  
- **External bias fields** for directional control  
- **Thrust enhancements** using high-Q materials, mode multiplexing, harmonics, dynamic geometry, coupled arrays, nonlinear media, and thermal gradients  

These publications ensure that such methods remain part of the **public domain of science**, serving as prior art against privatization while all rights remain reserved by the author.
