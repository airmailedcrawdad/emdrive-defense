## 1. Background
Conventional EM Drive concepts (e.g., Shawyer, NASA Eagleworks) describe truncated conical microwave cavities where resonant standing waves allegedly produce net thrust. These systems rely solely on geometric asymmetry and high-Q resonance, with no provisions for recursive collapse dynamics, invariant stabilization, or periodic drive schemes.

Patents such as **US 10,322,827 B2** address resonant structures for gravitational wave generation, but do not disclose or claim methods involving collapse-coordinate recursion, Floquet-driven detuning, or topological anchoring.

## 2. Improvements Disclosed Here

### 2.1 Nested Cavity Geometry (Recursive Coupling)
- Instead of a single truncated cone, the cavity is divided into multiple **alternating wide and narrow sections**, analogous to the SSH (Su–Schrieffer–Heeger) lattice in condensed matter physics.  
- Each transition acts as a strong/weak coupling boundary, creating a **recursive collapse lattice** for electromagnetic waves.  
- This allows collapse recursion to be stepped and biased deliberately, enhancing asymmetry far beyond simple conical geometry.  

**Patent Defense Note:** No prior EM Drive patents disclose alternating-section geometries designed to exploit lattice recursion; their claims are limited to single-cone shapes.

---

### 2.2 Boundary Anchoring via Dielectric Inserts
- At each wide/narrow transition, a **dielectric ring insert** is placed to function as a **boundary operator**.  
- These anchors stabilize **invariants** (Wilson/Zak/Berry phase analogs) within the cavity field distribution.  
- Without anchors, collapse recursion drifts and thrust washes out; with anchors, collapse remains phase-locked, sustaining net momentum bias.  

**Patent Defense Note:** Prior patents use dielectrics only for tuning or efficiency. Using them as *invariant anchors* tied to CCS is a novel and non-obvious application.

---

### 2.3 Floquet-Driven Modulation
- Instead of a static drive, the cavity is fed with a **frequency-modulated RF input**, oscillating around its primary resonance.  
- This **Floquet modulation** periodically detunes the recursive collapse ladder, stepping collapse indices forward and back in a controlled cycle.  
- The result is a **momentum pump** that transfers collapse bias across embeddings more efficiently than static standing waves.  

**Patent Defense Note:** No prior EM Drive disclosure claims frequency-swept or time-modulated drives for collapse recursion; they are limited to fixed resonant excitation.

---

### 2.4 External Bias Fields (λ + g(x) Envelope)
- Weak DC magnetic or electric fields are applied along the cavity axis.  
- These fields tilt the recursion ladder, biasing collapse toward one origin (–0 or +0) as defined by POF.  
- The effect is analogous to a **global bias plus shaped envelope** in the collapse-lattice processor.  

**Patent Defense Note:** While EM Drive patents acknowledge RF input power, none disclose auxiliary DC bias fields for steering recursive collapse. This is distinct and novel.

## 3. Combination of Elements
The system combines:
- Nested SSH-like geometry for recursive collapse channels.  
- Boundary anchoring for invariant stability.  
- Floquet modulation for dynamic recursion stepping.  
- External bias fields for directional control.  

This **synergistic combination** reinterprets EM Drive operation as a **recursive collapse engine** rather than a mere asymmetric microwave cavity.

## 4. Distinction from Prior Art
- **Shawyer/NASA EM Drive:** conical geometry, static resonance → lacks recursion, anchoring, modulation, or bias fields.  
- **US 10,322,827 B2:** spherical shell for gravitational waves → not thrust, not lattice recursion.  
- **Novelty Here:** explicit engineering of collapse coordinates using lattice geometry, invariant anchoring, and periodic modulation.

## 5. Defensive Purpose
This disclosure is intended to serve as **prior art** in the domain of resonant cavity propulsion. It blocks attempts to patent nested cavity geometries, anchored collapse invariants, Floquet-driven recursion, or bias-field-enhanced thrust systems, while reserving all rights to the author.
